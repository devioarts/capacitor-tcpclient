To keep things effective, please follow these simple guidelines:

## 🐞 Reporting Bugs

- Describe your environment (OS, version, browser/app, etc.).

## ✨ Requesting Features
- Explain **what** you want and **why** it’s useful.
- Describe **how** you expect it to behave.
- Add examples or use cases if possible.

## 💻 Contributing Code
